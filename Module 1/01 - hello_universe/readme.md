Now that you’ve installed Rust, let’s write your first Rust program. It’s traditional when learning a new language to write a little program that prints the text Hello, world! to the screen, so we’ll do the same here!

How to Run 
Run these Following Commands
---- for Linux
$ rustc hello.rs
$ ./hello 


----- For Windows  
> rustc hello.rs
> .\hello.exe
Hello, universe!

Kudos!
